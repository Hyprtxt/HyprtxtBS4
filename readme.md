# Bootstrap 4 for WordPress

This project is still very much in it's infancy. Bootstrap 4 is still on it's first alpha preview, but that shouldn't stop us from developing an awesome BS4 theme for WordPress developers.

I was inspired by the awesome work of [DevDM](http://devdm.com/) on [DevDmBootstrap3](https://github.com/dannymachal/DevDmBootstrap3). I am combining the best of DevDmBootstrap3 with things good parts of the [twentyfifteen] WordPress default theme.

## Features (So Far)

* Pagination
* Menu Walker
* Core Bootstrap4

## Future Plans

* SASS Support
* Stater Child Theme
* Sidebar + Widget Support
* Much More!
